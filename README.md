#### ExData_Plotting2
Contains the second project for the Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis class.  It holds a link to the original assignment plus all programs written to complete the assignment.

A link to the assignment is [here][1].  This link may break in short order once the class shuts down.  The assignment involved the analysis of a dataset holding emissions readings for PM2.5 pollution from various sources, nation-wide.  The data are organized at the county FIPS code level and would be ideal for mapping if a mapping data source with fips codes could be found.

There were 6 questions for the assignment.  In response, 6 different programs were written, each one in response to a specific question.
